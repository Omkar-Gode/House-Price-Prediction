* "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" is a competition dataset in kaggle in which we have to predict price of house using different aspects of house.

* In this Regression project I have performed Data Cleaning, Data Summerization, Visualization for gaining insights and better understandig of data.

* For the prediction, I used Linear Regression as baseline and after that I used Boosting algorithms like AdaBoost, GradientBoost. I also used Random Forest Regression tree for prediction of house price.

* Fine Tunning of algotithms is done using GridSearchCV.
